        <h1>Python QuestionsðŸš€</h1>
<h2>Easy Levelâœ…</h2>
<h1>1. What is Python?</h1>
<ul>
<li>A high level programming language that uses an interpreter.</li>
<li>We can have different paradigms in python, such as OOP, functional, procedural and etc.</li>
<li>It was invented in 1991 by Guido van Rossum.</li>
</ul>
<h1>2. What is a package in Python?</h1>
<ul>
<li>Package is a way of storing related modules in a directory. There is also a special <strong>init</strong>.py file in the directory, 
which is an indicator that this directory should be treated as a package.</li>
</ul>
<h1>3. How do you define a variable in Python?</h1>
<ul>
<li>Without specifiying the data type before setting it a name, which is unlike most other programming languages.</li>
</ul>
<h1>4. What is the difference between a list and a tuple in Python?</h1>
<ul>
<li>lists are mutable, they are created with [] brackets. Tuples are immutable, they are created using normal brackets (). 
They both serve the purpose of storing data. In terms of efficiency, tuples are a better option since our interpreter knows
that the tuples are going to remain constant.</li>
</ul>
<h1>5. How do you check the length of a string in Python?</h1>
<ul>
<li>You check the length of string in python by using the built-in function len() 
before the instance of the string object. </li>
</ul>
<h1>6. What is matplotlib in Python used for?</h1>
<ul>
<li>It is a python library used for creating static, interactive, and animated visualisations in python. 
It can be used for generating plots, histograms, scatter plots, bar charts, and more, 
making it a powerful tool for visualisation and analysis. It also can be integrated with 
Pandas library, as well as NumPy.</li>

</li>
</ul>
<h1>13. What is the difference between the return statement and the print statement in Python?</h1>
<p>return statement:<br></p>
<ul>
<li>The return statement is used inside a function to specify the value that the function should return as output.</li>
<li>It is used to exit the function and pass back a value to the caller.</li>
<li>A function can have multiple return statements, but only one of them will be executed when the function is called.</li>
<li>The return statement is essential for functions that are designed to perform computations and produce results that need to be used or stored for further processing.</li>
</ul>
<p>print statement:<br></p>
<ul>
<li>The print statement is used to output data to the console or other output streams.</li>
<li>It does not return a value; instead, it displays the specified data to the screen.</li>
<li>The print statement is primarily used for debugging purposes or for providing information to the user.</li>
<li>It can accept multiple arguments and can print variables, strings, numbers, and other data types.</li>
</ul>
<h1>14. How do you check if a number is even or odd in Python?</h1>
<p>if num % 2 == 0: <br>
    return True <br>
return False <br></p>

<p>The <strong>init</strong> method in Python is a special method, also known as a constructor, that is automatically called when a new instance of a class is created. Its primary purpose is to initialize the attributes of the newly created object.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>class Person:
    def <strong>init</strong>(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>9. How do you define and use class methods in Python?</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>class MyClass:
    @classmethod
    def class_method(cls, arg1, arg2):
        print("Class method called")
        print("Arguments:", arg1, arg2)
        print("Class:", cls)</p>
<p>cls refers to the class itself</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>10. What is a static method in Python?</h1>
<ul>
<li>A static method in Python is a method that belongs to a class but does not operate on instances of the class 
(i.e., it does not have access to instance attributes or methods). Instead, it is a method that is associated with
the class itself and can be called using the class name.</li>
</ul>
<h1>11. How do you define and use a static method?</h1>
<ul>
<li>class MyClass:
    @staticmethod
    def static_method(arg1, arg2):

        print("Arguments:", arg1, arg2)</li>
</ul>
<h1>12. What is object-oriented programming (OOP)?</h1>
<ul>
<li>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain 
data (attributes or properties) and code (methods or functions). It emphasizes the organization of software as a collection 
of objects that interact with each other to perform tasks. OOP aims to structure code in a way that models real-world entities 
and their relationships. </li>
</ul>
<h1>13. What are classes and objects in Python?</h1>
<ul>
<li>A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that all objects of the class will have.</li>
<li>Classes are defined using the class keyword, followed by the class name and a colon. The body of the class contains attribute and method definitions.</li>
</ul>
<h1>14. How do you define a class in Python?</h1>
<ul>
<li>In Python, you define a class using the class keyword followed by the class name and a colon :. </li>
<li>The body of the class contains attribute and method definitions, which encapsulate the data and behavior of objects created from the class. </li>
<li>Here's the general syntax for defining a class in Python:</li>
</ul>
<h1>15. What is inheritance in Python?</h1>
<ul>
<li>Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a new class (subclass or derived class) to inherit attributes and methods from an existing class (superclass or base class). In Python, inheritance enables code reuse and promotes the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes. </li>
</ul>
<h1>16. How do you implement inheritance in Python?</h1>
<p>class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        return "Animal speaks"</p>
<p>class Dog(Animal):<br />
    def bark(self):
        return "Woof!"</p>
<h1>17. What is method overriding?</h1>
<ul>
<li>Method overriding is a concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a </li>
<li>method that is already defined in its superclass. When a subclass overrides a method, it provides its own implementation of the method, which replaces the  - implementation inherited from the superclass.</li>
</ul>
<h1>18. How do you use the super() function in Python?</h1>
<ul>
<li>class Parent:
    def method(self):
        return "Parent method"</li>
</ul>
<p>class Child(Parent):
    def method(self):
        # Call superclass method
        result = super().method()
        return f"Child method, {result}"</p>
<p>obj = Child()
print(obj.method())  # Output: Child method, Parent method</p>
<h1>19. How do you handle exceptions in Python?</h1>
<ul>
<li>try-except blocks </li>
</ul>
<h1>20. What is the purpose of the try-except block?</h1>
<ul>
<li>The purpose of the try-except block in Python is to handle exceptions and gracefully manage errors that may occur during the execution of
a program. It allows you to anticipate potential errors, prevent your program from crashing, and provide alternative behavior or error messages 
when exceptions occur. </li>
